Dear User,

Welcome to Blood Frontier, and thanks for your interest! Please note that Blood Frontier is in early alpha stages, and as such, is not yet fully finished, polished, or even playable. It is intended as a multiplayer only demo of what is to come in future versions, meaning that singleplayer and enemies are not implemented yet. You are however invited to try out the features that have been added that will lead up to these things, such as; bots, online triggers, and much more :)

If you are interested in development, or require technical support please visit the #bloodfrontier IRC channel on freenode at irc://irc.freenode.net/bloodfrontier or you can visit our website, which offers more details at http://bloodfrontier.com/

The source code, license, and related documentation can be found in the 'src' subdirectory of this archive. Enjoy messing around with our little project, and be sure to have fun!

Regards,
	Acord, Quin, and the Blood Frontier Team

Humanity has spread throughout the solar system, to Mars and beyond. A vast communications network bridges from colony to colony, human to machine, and machine to human. This seemingly benign keystone of inter-planetary society, however, appears to be the carrier of a mysterious biological plague. Any persons so-connected seem to fall ill and die, only to return as ravenous, sub-human cannibals. You, a machine intelligence, an android, remain unafflicted by this phenomenon. You have been tasked with destroying the growing hordes of the infected, and, hopefully, locating and stopping the source of this epidemic.

Blood Frontier is a single-player and multi-player first-person shooter game, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2 (Sauerbraten). The project tries to work closely with the gaming and open source communities to provide a better overall experience, with a primary goal of creating a adventure based game environment that is flexible, fun, easy to use, and pleasing to the eye; it is a project with a true "by the people for the people" nature.

During its life, the goals of the project have shifted dramatically from its original concept, lending itself toward a more balanced gameplay, completely at the control of map makers, while maintaining a general theme of tactics and low gravity. Building upon a main philosophy of making a game everyone likes, Quin attempts to make the development process more open, with ideas coming in from every direction, from your average player to your seasoned developer.

The main adventure component of Blood Frontier will always be Free and Open Source Software, the only restriction is that currently you are free to distribute but not copy or reuse the artwork without permission. This project will eventually release its assests under an as-yet undetermined open source license, once it reaches full version. For a full list of people who have contributed see the Credits. For licensing information, please see the License.

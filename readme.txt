Blood Frontier Alpha
====================

Welcome to Blood Frontier, and thanks for your interest!

Blood Frontier is a standalone game based on the Sauerbraten (Cube 2) Engine by
	Wouter "aardappel" van Oortmerssen and Lee "eihrul" Salzman, to which many
	thanks go to for making this project possible with their open sourced
	engine. A special thanks goes to eihrul for his help, guidance, opinions,
	and overall friendship, it will always be appreciated.

Please note that Blood Frontier is in early alpha stages, and as such, is not
	yet fully finished, polished, or even playable. It is intended as a
	multiplayer only demo of what is to come in future versions, meaning
	that singleplayer and monsters are not implemented yet.

If you are interested in development, or require technical support please visit
	the Blood Frontier discussion group at:

The source code, license, and related documentation can be found in the 'src'
	subdirectory of this archive.

Enjoy messing around with our little project, and be sure to have fun!

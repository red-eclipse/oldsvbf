<a name="Game_modes"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Game modes</span></h2>
<p>There are a number of different game modes to choose from, as shown below:
</p>
<a name="Deathmatch"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Deathmatch</span></h3>
<p>Traditional deathmatch. Collect weapons as fast as possible to battle opponents in a fierce battle to the death. Don't let your opponents
get the upper hand, or you will be hunted like a rabbit once you respawn! The player with the most kills at the end of the time limit wins.
</p>
<a name="Secure_the_flag"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Secure the flag</span></h3>
<p>A battle between two teams for domination of the map. Capture key positions by standing next to flags until they change to your colour. Earn the most points by holding as many flags as possible. Don't forget to grab weapons, because you can expect the enemy to be coming for your flags! The team with the most points at the end of the time limit wins.
</p>
<a name="Capture_the_flag"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Capture the flag</span></h3>
<p>A game of skill, cunning and strategy, you must steal the enemy's flag and return it to your base to score. But don't let the enemy steal your flag, because you can't score until you return it! The team with the most flags at the end of the time limit wins.
</p>
<a name="Lobby"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Lobby</span></h3>
<p>The lobby mode is used for the lobby map "Overseer" and doesn't do much: you can run around in the map and pick up weapons, but you can't
take damage. Not intended for playing.
</p>
<a name="Editing"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Editing</span></h3>
<p>Editing mode is used for creating maps. See the <a href="Documentation.html" title="Documentation">Documentation</a> on editing if you are interested in content creation.
</p>
<a name="Mutators"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Mutators</span></h2>
<p>Mutators are used to change the rules of the game. Unlike game modes, you can have more than one mutator active at any one time.
</p>
<a name="Multi-sided"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Multi-sided</span></h3>
<p>You will fight in four teams instead of two. In deathmatch mode, this will automatically start a team game (instead of free-for-all).
</p>
<a name="Teamplay"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Teamplay</span></h3>
<p>For deathmatch mode, players will be split into two teams instead of fighting individually. Secure the flag and Capture the flag modes are already team games, so this mutator will not affect those modes.
</p>
<a name="Instagib"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Instagib</span></h3>
<p>All players start with a rifle. One shot kills the enemy instantly, no matter where they are hit.
</p>
<a name="Duel"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Duel</span></h3>
<p>Players take turns to duel each other, two at a time. If a player survives the duel, they will keep playing the other players until they die. If both players die, neither plays in the next duel. The duel mutator can only be used in the deathmatch game mode.
</p>
<a name="Last_Man"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Last Man</span></h3>
<p>Survival of the fittest! All players spawn at the same time, then fight it out to see who is the strongest. Players who die may not respawn until there is a single clear winner (or everybody dies). At this time, a new round is started and everyone respawns together. The Last man mutator can only be used in the deathmatch game mode.
</p>
<a name="Paintball"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Paintball</span></h3>
<p>Paintball mode! You will be given a paintball marker and must tag your opponents with paint. Tagging an opponent freezes them in their tracks for a short time, but once they are un-frozen they cannot be tagged for a few seconds. However, they can still tag you so get moving! 5 tags will knock a player out and they must respawn.
</p>
<a name="Paintball_in_deathmatch_mode"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Paintball in deathmatch mode</span></h4>
<p>At the end of the time limit, the player with the most tags wins.
</p>
<a name="Paintball_in_secure_the_flag_mode"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Paintball in secure the flag mode</span></h4>
<p>As with normal STF. You will still be capturing the flag even after you are tagged.
</p>
<a name="Paintball_in_capture_the_flag_mode"></a><h4> <span class="mw-headline">Paintball in capture the flag mode</span></h4>
<p>As with normal CTF, but tagging a player once is not sufficient to make them drop the flag. They must be tagged five times to knock them out!

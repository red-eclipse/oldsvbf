</td><td> Playing Blood Frontier is not unlike many First Person Shooters, the name of the genre explains it all, you shoot. There are, however, a few things in this game that are a little different to most. The first is health regeneration, and the second is unlimited ammo and reloading.

<a name="Health_and_Regeneration"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Health and Regeneration </span></h2>
<p>You start out with 100 health, and whatever armour is built into your "chassis". You don't need to pick up armour, it's just always there, you don't need to even think about it. Through the various ways you can be damaged, you will lose health, when you reach zero you will be dead. You can see your health by observing the colour of your crosshair; the closer it is to red, the closer you are to meeting your maker (assuming they were like, infected and killed already or something).
</p><p>In <a href="Playing_the_game.html#Deathmatch">Deathmatch</a>, whoever delivered the final blow will score a "frag", which is a point for eradicating you from the playing field. Conversely, if you fall in lava, out of the playing field, or commit suicide you will lose a frag. If after an onslaught (3 secs) you haven't been killed and manage to get away, you will slowly regenerate your your health (10 health every 1 sec) until your life is restored. BEWARE though, this does not make you invincible; if you get damaged again the regeneration will stop and you will have to wait the full time (3 secs) before you start regenerating again!
</p>
<a name="Weapons.2C_Ammo.2C_and_Reloading"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Weapons, Ammo, and Reloading </span></h2>
<p>In most games, you begin your life with a trusty Plasma Pistol, or the Laser Rifle in <a href="Playing_the_game.html#Instagib" class="new" title="Gamemodes (not yet written)">Instagib</a>. The first thing you need to know is that <i>every</i> weapon except the Grenades has unlimited ammo; when you run out simply reload your weapon (press R), which you can do at any time. If your ammo is depleted, reloading happens automatically. You also need to be aware that not all weapons start out with their maximum ammo; weapons like the Shotgun and Laser Rifle can be "overloaded", allowing you to stock up in quiet moments and let leash a torrent of mayhem when you finally face down your foe!

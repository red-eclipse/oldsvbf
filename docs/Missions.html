			<p>In the distant future, humanity has spread throughout the solar system, to Mars and beyond. A vast communications network bridges from colony to colony, human to machine, and machine to human. This seemingly benign keystone of modern inter-planetary society, however, appears to be the carrier of a mysterious techno-biological plague. Any persons so-connected seem to fall ill and die, only to return as ravenous, sub-human cannibals. You, a machine intelligence, an android, remain unafflicted by this strange phenomenon and have been tasked with destroying the growing hordes of the infected, while, hopefully, locating and stopping the source of the epidemic.

<a name="Infection"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline"> Infection </span></h2>
<a name="Mission_1:_Escape"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mission 1: Escape</span></h3>
<ul><li> The player(s) awake at the hands of two techs, who have brought them out of storage and activated them in the hope that they can avert the deaths of the many, many personnel aboard the research station CERES.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The player(s) are machine intelligences, MIs. MIs are illegal in all systems except for emergency military usage, due to fears after a robot rebellion long ago. Of course, this has not stopped the military from investigating their usefulness. The players are all prototypes, and none of them necessarily have to obey any of the traditional Asimov laws, but they do have to obey orders from the military. If no orders are forthcoming, they are left to make decisions on their own.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> After the players are activated, both of the techs fall ill and start dying, even though neither tech has been bitten. They have collected pistols from the station armory. They hand out these pistols and order the players out to find other survivors. Immediately after the players exit the lab, the door locks and two gun shots are heard – the techs committing suicide rather than converting.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The players can detour to the armory, which contains 4 <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bloodfrontier/index.php?title=Grenades" title="Grenades">Grenades</a>, a shotgun, and a plasma pistol.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The level is randomized – routes are open or closed depending on which random configuration is chosen. Point A, the starting point, is always outside of the lab(one of two points) and point B, the ending point, is always one of the shipping containers in the docking bay. The route available is randomly chosen from a list in the map.cfg.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Upon arriving at the docking bay, the players will find several infected crowded around one shipping container, in which there are two screaming survivors. Upon rescue, the survivors, two unarmed Russian Orthodox Missionaries named Sergei and Helena, volunteer to take the players with them to their next location – Airen’s Rock, a mining colony in need of medical supplies.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<a name="Mission_2:_Airen.27s_Rock"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mission 2: Airen's Rock</span></h3>
<ul><li> Airen’s Rock is an asteroid mining settlement. The settlement was recently dropped in priority from Solcorp shipping routes due to low profits, and as such has to rely partially on outside resources for medicine, food, and supplies.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Upon arrival, there is no response from the asteroid. Helena hacks into the station computers and discovers that it is overrun with infected, but the ship must refuel to continue travelling. The players are the natural choice to enter the station, fight their way through the infected, and operate the fueling apparatus.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The players start at one of two docks, and must make their way to the fueling station. They must then go from the fueling station to the OTHER dock. Along the way, they must also enter the office of a “crackpot” scientist, who has been tracking the infestation. The results point to a growing radius of infection, as opposed to a vectored infection. The excuse to do this is to retrieve a key to the science wing, which the players will need to travel back through in order to reach the dock due to a malfunction in the station systems that disables most of the security <a href="Doors.html" title="Doors">Doors</a>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> There is of course an optional detour – one of two security offices. There are two shotguns and two submachine guns in each, along with several <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bloodfrontier/index.php?title=Grenades" title="Grenades">Grenades</a>.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Helena and Sergei offer comments and open routes throughout. There is also a short discussion <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bloodfrontier/index.php?title=About" title="About">About</a> the radius infection, where Helena divulges that their faith disallows them from using the cybernetic enhancements that have become almost universally popular – the most common of which is the wireless mind to machine interface, which is driven by nanotech. She suspects that there is a signal that hijacks the nanites in the interface to construct the virus from scratch using materials harvested from the host body.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The decision is made to take this information to military authorities aboard the Citadel, a nearby shipyard and military installation utilized jointly by the Republic and the Alliance. Helena notes that by the time they arrive though, the citadel is projected to be within the infection radius.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<a name="Mission_3:_The_Citadel"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mission 3: The Citadel</span></h3>
<ul><li> Upon arriving, surprisingly, the ship is contacted by Admiral Sethis, who has not bothered to get any cybernetic augmentations due to his age and has not been bitten. He is holed up in the Citadel’s hardened command center, along with several experts who have not had augmentation performed for security reasons.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> After a short conversation, Sergei transmits the data to the survivors. The Admiral decides that it is their best lead, and that they do have a world on file that is at the epicenter of the infection radius, although it is not on commercial maps. He explains that it was removed from all civilian and most military records because it was the center of too much contention, and that it is mentioned to be “cursed”, although the specifics have been wiped from ALL records.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> He requests assistance in getting to the <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bloodfrontier/index.php?title=Weapons" title="Weapons">Weapons</a> bay, where they can activate a warship using his command authority. He mentions two scary things: First, the infected here are more intelligent than previously documented infected and utilize tools and <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bloodfrontier/index.php?title=Weapons" title="Weapons">Weapons</a>, and second, the citadel is built to disallow communications to anyone outside of the installation, which means that the players will be out of contact with Sergei and Helena. The admiral dispatches a different MI assault team to recon the target, although they lack the firepower to destroy a large installation.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The map always starts at point A, which is dock 17. The map then progresses through a random route to the command center. The admiral and his team stay in contact with the player, opening <a href="Doors.html" title="Doors">Doors</a> and giving directions. Upon getting close to the command center, radio transmissions reveal that some of the intelligent infected have utilized explosives on the door, and upon arrival everyone is dead except for one expert, who tells them that activating a dormant warship is now impossible because the Admiral is dead. He reveals that there is an already activated warship that can do the job, but that they have lost contact with it. He gives the players a datapad with the necessary information on the location of the ship, along with authorization. He then sets the installation’s apocalypse protocol, which activates turrets and a self-destruct timer before committing suicide.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The citadel contains several armories. Flamers, shotguns, sub-machine guns, carbines, plasma pistols and <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bloodfrontier/index.php?title=Grenades" title="Grenades">Grenades</a> are in plentiful supply.  The infected tend to utilize carbines, sub-machine guns, and pistols, since their relatively poor accuracy makes immolating other infected with some of the larger <a href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/bloodfrontier/index.php?title=Weapons" title="Weapons">Weapons</a> a very real possibility.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Unlike other maps, the players must travel back through the same route. The infected seem to be much more intent on killing the players this time around, and are acting in a more focused manner, hinting for the first time that there is a greater intelligence behind them.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Sergei and Helena agree to take the team out to the warship, but want to head to a nearby Russian Orthodox settlement and wait out the crisis, because according to their calculations, the radius infection will reach almost all human settlements before the threat can be destroyed, and they want to be somewhere safe with their family.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<a name="Mission_4:_Warship_Aggressor"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Mission 4: Warship Aggressor</span></h3>
<ul><li> The team arrives, and the warship is still at the same location. Sergei and Helena transmit authorization. The Aggressor AI, Laura, contacts the team and explains that the ship is overrun, and that almost all of the on board defenses have been destroyed. The AI chooses the best route for the team to infiltrate the ship and take the command center.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The route that the AI chooses starts from one of two hangar decks. The route from each deck is randomized, although the destination is always the command center. The ship AI informs the players that they were returning from rescuing several thousand colonists, who are now infected. The ship AI also warns that the infected are organized, and destroyed the ship’s MI crew while they were deactivated.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The aggressor is SWARMING with infected. Unlike any other map, the variations in the infected here are more the norm and not the exception.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Upon arriving at the command center, Laura notifies them that the recon mission was successful, and that they have their target – an abandoned two hundred year old industrial installation that houses a malignant AI bent on destroying and remaking the human race.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> The Aggressor arrives in orbit around the planet and commences bombardment. The planet is Earth, and of course nobody recognizes the significance. After the destruction of the facility and several hundred miles of surrounding (abandoned)cities and countryside, the AI takes control of the ship and flies it to an uncharted planet that is meant to reseed the human race in the event of an apocalyptic war. The planet falls well outside of the infection radius, and is shielded from outside contact by a red giant sun that makes communications with the system from the outside impossible and hiding them from anyone looking for evidence of life.

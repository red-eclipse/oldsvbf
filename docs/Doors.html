<a name="Doors_in_Blood_Frontier"></a><h2> <span class="mw-headline">Doors in <a href="Blood_Frontier.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Blood Frontier">Blood Frontier</a></span></h2>
<p>There are two types of doors in <a href="Blood_Frontier.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Blood Frontier">Blood Frontier</a>: Decorative, and animated. The decorative doors will all be animated at some point in the future, but for now please only use the animated doors.
</p><p>These doors are found under data/models/<a href="Acord.html" class="new" title="Acord (not yet written)">Acord</a>/doors, in their own named sub directories.
</p>
<a name="Placing_a_Door"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Placing a Door</span></h3>
<p>Doors are really map models, so you would place them by opening the cosole(tilde) and typing
</p>
<pre>/newent mapmodel N
</pre>
<p>Where N is the index number of the map model. If you are unsure, check you map config file. The first model listed will be at index 0, the next at 1 and so-on.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<a name="Placing_a_Trigger"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Placing a Trigger</span></h3>
<p>Triggers are a little more complicated. To place a trigger, point to the place you want it, open the console(tilde) and type
</p>
<pre>/newent trigger A B C D
</pre>
<p>Each of the letters is an attribute.
</p>
<pre>A: Index(idx)

This is the index number of the trigger. This is only important when using the trigger to call a script. 
See below for details.
</pre>
<pre>B: Type

0 = toggle, 1 = automatic, 2 = script

Toggle: Toggles the state of the linked object. For example, a door that is open will close, and a door
that is closed will open, and stay that way. 

Automatic: Toggles the state of the linked object on, and then off again after a certain amount of time.

Script: Activate the script in the map config file that corresponds to the trigger index number. 
IMPORTANT: SCRIPTS ONLY WORK ON THE LOCAL PLAYER, AND NOT ON THE SERVER. IT IS CURRENTLY USED TO BRING 
UP INTERFACE MENUS. SCRIPTS WILL NOT WORK ONLINE.
</pre>
<pre>C: Activation Type

0 = none, 1 = detect, 2 = use

Indirect: This trigger can not be activated directly, and must be activated by another trigger, such as
a switch or an ID card sort of thing. NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.

Detect: This trigger activates when it detects a player inside of it's radius.

Use: This trigger must be actively used by the player - by pressing the E key.
</pre>
<pre>D: Radius
The default radius is 16 units, which is fairly large, but you could change it if you wanted to. 
WARNING: If two triggers are overlapping radii, then only the one closest to the player will function.
Do not place your triggers too close together.
</pre>
<p><br />
</p>
<a name="Linking_Triggers"></a><h3> <span class="mw-headline">Linking Triggers</span></h3>
<p>Linking triggers to things is fairly easy! Simply select the two things that you want to interact, such as a door and a trigger, and press the L key TWICE. You should see an arrow from the door pointing towards your trigger, and vice-versa. Now, whenever a player interacts with your trigger it will activate the appropriate action.
</p><p>If you have remapped your keys, the L key calls the entlink command. So instead, you can open the console and type
</p>
<pre>/entlink
</pre>
<p>instead. But remember to do it TWICE so that arrows go BOTH DIRECTIONS.

* Look at making the server and vote menu shift positions less often
* Re-init playerstarts in editmode
* Make a better RL altfire
* Fix /newmap issues with autoget/send
* Work out why bans don't stick
* Reduce shotgun insta-kill likelihood and fix self-hits
* Optical effects (sprinting. etc)
* Integrate new zombie model
* Make 'tags' and/or 'theme' fields
* Move things like mastermode, ban, etc to server side commands/variables
* Undo forced impulse vars
* Move to mutators: spawngrenades?, vampire, itemsallowed?, itemdropping?, kamikaze?, duelreset?, duelclear?, selfdamage?, trialdamage?, teamdamage?, ctfstyle, stfstyle, (low/high gravity?), extrahealth?
* Remember ammo counts for dropped weapons
* Give remaining interactive entities a mode field
* Make checkpoints/triggers linkable for a determined order (add to kinship system)
* Create "assisted secures" for stf (player1, player2, player3 secured flag N)
* Create "assisted deaths" (make server aware of floor state too for assisted falling?)
* Allow premature detonation by firing/exploding certain weapons at plasma/grenades
* Try to balance kamikaze grenades better (timer? penalty?)
* Re-balance shotgun (more spread/less bullets?)
* Make glass more visible/look better (combined texture?)
* Elaborate and refine Story mode/AI
* Master server tracking and unlockable system

! Keep an eye out for the elusive grenade bugs
